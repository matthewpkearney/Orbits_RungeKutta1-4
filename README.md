Runge Kutta is a orbital methodology which estimates the positions of trajectory around a stationary center of mass (COM). This project leverages the differential solutions in the first through fourth order, realizing the improvement of the models trajectory upon higher order differentials. I visualize the trajectories using a data pipeline to matplotlib, simulating Runge-kutta orbital patterns. Note: it may be effective to use another technology (Jupyter notebooks, a server, etc) to visualize the 4 orbits together...
